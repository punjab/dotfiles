## Background
Come home to [Vim](http://www.vim.org) as default editor and [Zsh](http://www.zsh.org) as default shell.

Zsh uses [oh-myzsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh). They are maintained seperately, thus install it from [here](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) before moving ahead. Back? Now proceed.

Start by cloning the repository.

```
git clone git@github.com:punjab/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
cd ~/.dotfiles
rake install
```

Now restart the sesion.
