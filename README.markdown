## dotfiles

My spartan dotfiles setup

- [Zsh](http://www.zsh.org) as default shell
- [Vim](http://www.vim.org) as default editor

## How to use

Zsh uses [oh-myzsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh), thus clone it from [here](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) into your root directory before moving ahead. Back? Now proceed.

Now follow these commands.

```
git clone git@github.com:punjab/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
cd ~/.dotfiles
rake install
```

Now restart the sesion. That is it.
